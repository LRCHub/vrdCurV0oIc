Fly me to the moon
And let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like
On Jupiter and Mars
In other words,
Hold my hand
In other words,
Darling, kiss me.

And fill my heart with song
And let me sing for ever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words,
Please be true
In other words,
I love you.

So fill my heart with song
Let me sing for ever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words,
Please be true
In other words,
I love you.
