Fly me to the moon
And let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like on
Jupiter and Mars
In other words
hold my hand
In other words
baby kiss me
Fill my heart with song
And let tme sing forever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words
please be true
In other words
I love you

Fly me to the moon
And let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like on
Jupiter and Mars
In other words hold my hand
In other words baby kiss me
Fill my heart with song
And let tme sing forever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words
please be true
In other words
In other words
In other words
I love you
